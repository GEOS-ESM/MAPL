# Test Case Descriptions

Note all test cases are in a numbered directory caseX, where a X is an integer and each case is described in the following list where the list number X is for folder caseX

1. 12-month/12 time 2004 file with 2 updates, non-climatology
2. 12-month/12 time 2004 file with 2 updates, climatology
3. monthly files for 2004 file with 1 updates, climatology for 2007
4. simple everytime update with daily files and no time interpolation
5. simple everytime update with daily files and time interpolation
6. daily files for 0z for a year, fill a time at 12z on the 31st of december 2006 as a climatology
7. 12-month/12 time 2004 file with an update that will wrap around the year
8. simple everytime update with a new file every 3 hours relative to 003000z
9. Single time file, persisted at all times
10. Interpolation outside of data set (Harvard mode), make a multi year dataset. Define as not a climatology and ask for data after dataset time range
11. Interpolation outside of data set (Harvard mode), make a multi year dataset. Define as not a climatology and ask for data before datset time range
13. Testing that we can take a climatology for a non-leap year and interpolate to a leap year. 12 files each with the midmonth value for 2007 (non-leap year). Interpolate to 02/29/2008 (leap year)
14. Testing that we can take a climatology for a non-leap year and interpolate to a leap year. Daily files each with 1 value for 2007 (non-leap year). Interpolate to 02/29/2008 (leap year)
15. Testing that we can take a climatology for a non-leap year and interpolate to a non-leap year. Daily files each with 1 value for 2007 (non-leap year). Interpolate to 03/29/2006 (leap year)
16. Testing that we can take a climatology for a leap year and interpolate to a non-leap year. Daily files each with 1 value for 2008 (leap year). Interpolate to 03/29/2006 15z (leap year)
17. Test ability of ExtData (2G only) to allow for subconfigs, i.e. split input yaml files into multiple files
19. Test set file to /dev/null
22. Test multiple rules for an item
23. Test multiple datasets and treat Climatology in the first and a real-time in the 2nd
24. Test ability to read and write cubed-sphere files
30. Case1 with deflate compression
39. Test adding a scaling and offset to an item

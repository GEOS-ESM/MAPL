This benchmark simulates writing a series of 3D variables of a given cubed-sphere resolution to a file using the same strategies as used by the real checkpoint code in MAPL

The code has the following command line options:

```
  -h, --help                 This message.
  --config_file              The configuration file to use
  --nx                       The number of cells in the x direction (default=4)
  --ny                       The number of cells in the y direction (default=4)
  --im_world                 The resolution of the cubed sphere (default=90)
  --lm                       The number of levels in each 3D variable (default=137)
  --num_readers              The number of processes that will read (default=1)
  --num_arrays               The number of 3D arrays to read (default=5)
  --ntrials                  The number of trials to run (default=3)
  --split_file               Split the file into multiple files (default=False)
  --scatter_3d               Scatter 3D data (default=False)
  --read_barrier             Add a read barrier (default=False)
  --no_random_data           Do not random data (default=False)
  --do_no_reads              Do not read data (default=False)
  --no_netcdf_reads          Do not read data as netcdf (default=False)
```

NOTE 1: This program *REQUIRES* a file called `checkpoint.nc4` that is generated by the `checkpoint_benchmark.x` code

NOTE 2: If you specify a `config_file` it must be an ESMF Config file with the following options:

- "NX:" the x distribution for each face
- "NY:" the y distribution for each face
- "IM\_WORLD:" the cube resolution
- "LM:" the number of levels
- "NUM\_WRITERS:" the number of writing processes either to a single or independent files
- "NUM\_ARRAYS:" the number of 3D variables to write to the file
- "CHUNK:" whether to chunk, default `.true.`
- "SCATTER\_3D:" gather all levels at once (default is `.false` which means a level at a time is gathered)
- "SPLIT\_FILE:" default `.false`, if `.true.`, each writer writes to and independent file
- "WRITE\_BARRIER:" default `.false`, add a barrier before each write to for synchronization
- "DO\_WRITES:" default `.true.`, if `.false` skips writing (so just an mpi test at that point)
- "NTRIAL:" default 1, the number of trials to make writing
- "RANDOM\_DATA:" default `.true.`, if `.true.` will arrays with random data, if `.false` sets the array to the rank of the process

NOTE 3: whatever you set NX and NY to the program must be run on `6*NY*NY` processors and the number of writers must evenly divide `6*NY`

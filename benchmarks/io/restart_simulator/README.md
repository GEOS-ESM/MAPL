This benchmark simulates reading a series of 3D variables of a given cubed-sphere resolution to a file using the same strategies as used by the real checkpoint code in MAPL

The code has the following command line options:

```
  -h, --help                 This message.
  --config_file              The configuration file to use
  --nx                       The number of cells in the x direction (default: 4)
  --ny                       The number of cells in the y direction (default: 4)
  --im_world                 The resolution of the cubed sphere (default: 90)
  --lm                       The number of levels in each 3D variable (default: 137)
  --num_readers              The number of processes that will read (default: 1)
  --num_arrays               The number of 3D arrays to read (default: 5)
  --ntrials                  The number of trials to run (default: 3)
  --split_file               Read split files instead of a single file (default: read single file)
  --scatter_3d               Scatter all the levels at once instead of one at a time (default: scatter one at a time)
  --read_barrier             Add a barrier after every read (default: no barrier)
  --static_data              Use static data (rank of process) instead of random data (default: random data)
  --suppress_reads           Do not read data (default: read data)
  --read_binary              Read binary data instead of netCDF (default: netCDF data)
```

NOTE 1: This program *REQUIRES* a file called `checkpoint.nc4` that is generated by the `checkpoint_benchmark.x` code.

NOTE 2: If you specify a `config_file` it must be an ESMF Config file with the following options:

- "NX:" the x distribution for each face
- "NY:" the y distribution for each face
- "IM\_WORLD:" the cube resolution
- "LM:" the number of levels
- "NUM\_READERS:" the number of reading processes either from a single or independent files
- "NUM\_ARRAYS:" the number of 3D variables to read from the file
- "SCATTER\_3D:" scatter all levels at once (default is `.false` which means a level at a time is gathered)
- "SPLIT\_FILE:" default `.false`, if `.true.`, each reader reads from an independent file
- "READ\_BARRIER:" default `.false`, add a barrier before each read for synchronization
- "DO\_READS:" default `.true.`, if `.false` skips reading (so just an mpi test at that point)
- "NTRIALS:" default 3, the number of trials to make for each read
- "RANDOM\_DATA:" default `.true.`, if `.true.` will arrays with random data, if `.false` sets the array to the rank of the process

NOTE 3: whatever you set NX and NY to the program must be run on `6*NY*NY` processors and the number of readers must evenly divide `6*NY`
